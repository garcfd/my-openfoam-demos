MRF case setup
==============
requires:

2 mesh directories
topoSetDict (to create inner mesh zone0)
createPatchDict (to create cyclic boundaries)
MRFProperties (to specify the rotation)

start with sphere and blades geometry - the sphere defined the cyclic interface

generate 2 seperate case directories - 1 for inner mesh, and 1 for outer mesh

using snappyHexMesh 
- move point location for inner mesh with sphere_inner surface names
- move point location for outer mesh with sphere_outer surface names
(move dir 2 to 0)

for the inner mesh use topoSetDict to create mesh "zone0" for entire inner mesh

then go above both case directories and use mergeMeshes <dir1> <dir2>

this creates a new "1" dir in the <dir1>, so then move this "1" to "0"

use paraview with "read zones" toggled ON, to check the inner zone is seperate.

use createPatch to make the cyclic boundaries for sphere_inner and sphere_outer

check that its listed as cyclicAMI in the boundary file 

update the boundary files p U k omega nut with cyclicAMI

create or modify the MRFProperties file in "constant" dir to set omega (speed)

run in simpleFoam as normal
